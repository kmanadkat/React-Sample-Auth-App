# React Redux Auth & Todo App

This is a scaffold like React Redux project. It contains a primary auth & route protection. After signing in you would see a classic Todo app. It is intended to be used by my Medium blog post readers as a sample project to learn how to deploy React Redux apps to Googl Firebase.
